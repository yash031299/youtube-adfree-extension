## 🧑‍💻 How does it work?

This extension cleverly tweaks YouTube video URLs and opens them in a third-party ad-free player (`yout-ube.com`). This removes all YouTube ads—no blockers, no popups, just pure video!  
*You might lose comments, likes, or some YouTube features, but you gain an ad-free experience.*
